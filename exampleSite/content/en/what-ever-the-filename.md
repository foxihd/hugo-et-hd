You can do a lot of things in every single slide.

### Make a First Impresssion and Engage Your Audience
In your markdown preamble, add the variable `type` with the value `slide`, then rearrange the order with the `weight` variable.
```md
---
title: 'This is Landing Slide Title'
type: 'slide'
weight: 1
---
<!--your content here-->
```

### Either Take Control of the Landing or Slide-off
To replace the landing page slider, add your very own `landing.html` to your `partials/custom` directory, or disable the `slider` in your site configuration under `[Params.Home]`.

### Or wait! How about the orange fun?
